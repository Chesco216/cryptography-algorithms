This code implements the Rijndael algorithm, a widely used symmetric key encryption standard, to encrypt and decrypt information. It provides a user-friendly interface for:

Encrypting plain text using a password.
Decrypting Base64-encoded ciphertext using a password.
Features:

Secure Rijndael encryption/decryption.
User-friendly interface with clear labels and placeholders.
Separate sections for encryption and decryption functionalities.
Read-only output fields for security.
Getting Started

Prerequisites:

Basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (for interactivity).
A text editor or IDE of your choice.
Download/Clone:

Download the code files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
Alternatively, clone the repository (if applicable).
Set Up:

Unzip the downloaded files or navigate to the cloned directory.
Ensure all files (index.html, index.css, script.js) are present in the same location.
Run:

Open index.html in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
The interface will be displayed.
Using the Tool

Encryption:

Enter a password: Type your desired password in the "Contrase침a" (Password) field under the "Encriptar" (Encrypt) section.
Enter information to encrypt:
Plain text: Paste the text you want to encrypt into the "Informaci칩n para encriptar" (Information to Encrypt) textarea.
JSON or other data: You can also use this field for JSON objects or other data types.
Click "Encriptar" (Encrypt): The encrypted ciphertext (in Base64 format) will be displayed in the "Resultado" (Result) field.
Decryption:

Enter the password used for encryption: Type the same password you used for encryption into the "Contrase침a" (Password) field under the "Desencriptar" (Decrypt) section.
Enter information to decrypt: Paste the Base64-encoded ciphertext you obtained from the encryption step into the "Informaci칩n para desencriptar, en base64" (Information to Decrypt, in Base64) textarea.
Click "Desencriptar" (Decrypt): The decrypted plain text will be displayed in the "Resultado" (Result) field.
Additional Notes:

For security reasons, the encrypted ciphertext is displayed in Base64 format, which is human-readable but not the original binary data.
Ensure you keep the password used for encryption confidential to prevent unauthorized decryption.
